Just a silly little class project in php and postgres.

Issues that still need to be resolved: 

 - user persistence (cookies)
 - create updatekontact form
 - fix organization search (special case)
 - logic for updatekontact 
 - addkontact does not yet insert associated userid.
    This will have to happen after cookies have been implemented.
